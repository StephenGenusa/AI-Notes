### **Document Manifesto**

This document is a **non-negotiable, executable specification** for an autonomous AI development agent. It is the definitive source of truth. The AI's primary directive is to implement this specification precisely as written.

**Assume zero implicit knowledge.** Any ambiguity will be treated as a blocker, not an opportunity for creative interpretation. The TDD must be sufficiently detailed for the AI to autonomously generate:
1.  Production-ready code.
2.  Comprehensive unit, integration, and end-to-end tests.
3.  Infrastructure as Code (IaC) definitions.
4.  Observability dashboards and alerts.
5.  All required documentation.

Every decision herein is deliberate. Traceability from business goals to code is paramount.

- **Associated Repositories:** [Links to `github.com/org/repo`, etc.]

#### **2. Executive Summary (TL;DR)**
- **Problem Statement:** [One sentence. *Example: Users cannot pay for subscriptions with PayPal, leading to an estimated 5% cart abandonment.*]
- **Proposed Solution:** [One sentence. *Example: Implement a new, stateless microservice that integrates with the PayPal REST API and orchestrates the payment flow.*]
- **Expected Outcome:** [One sentence. *Example: Reduce cart abandonment by 5% and increase total subscription revenue by 3% within the first quarter post-launch.*]

#### **3. Business Context & Scope**
- **Current State:** [Describe the existing system/process and its architecture. Where does this new component fit? Use diagrams if complex.]
- **Problem Deep Dive:** [Expand on the TL;DR. Use data and metrics to quantify the pain points. Why is this problem important to solve *now*?]
- **User Stories / Job Stories:** [List the key user stories. This provides crucial context for acceptance criteria. *Example: "As a shopper, I want to securely connect my PayPal account so that I can complete my purchase without entering credit card details."*]
- **Target Audience:** [Who is the end user? (e.g., External customers on web, internal finance team on an admin panel).]

#### **4. Objectives and Key Results (OKRs)**
- **Business Objectives (Must-Haves):**
  - [Objective 1: *Example: Increase payment method diversity on the platform.*]
- **Business Success Metrics (How we measure business success):**
  - [Metric 1: *Achieve >1,000 successful PayPal transactions in the first month.*]
  - [Metric 2: *PayPal represents >10% of all new subscription payments within 2 months.*]
- **Technical Success Criteria (How we measure technical success):**
  - [Criteria 1: *End-to-end payment processing latency (p99) is < 800ms.*]
  - [Criteria 2: *Service error rate is < 0.1% for all successful requests.*]

#### **5. Boundaries & Constraints**
- **In Scope:** [List what this service *will* do.]
- **Out of Scope (Non-Goals):** [Be explicit. *Example: This system will not store any raw credit card numbers. It will not manage recurring billing logic; that is handled by the Subscriptions service.*]
- **Technical Constraints:** [Immutable decisions. *Example: Must be written in Go 1.22+. Must be deployed to AWS EKS in `us-east-1`. Must use PostgreSQL 15+.*]
- **Dependencies:** [External teams, services, or events that must be ready. *Example: `AuthService` must provide a new JWT scope `payments:write` before deployment.*]
- **Assumptions:** [What are we assuming to be true? *Example: The PayPal sandbox environment is a stable and accurate representation of their production API.*]

### **Part 2: The "How" — The Executable Specification**

#### **6. Architecture**
- **System Context Diagram (C4 Model):** [Mandatory. Shows the system in its environment with all key external dependencies (users, other services).]
- **Component Diagram:** [Mandatory. Breaks down the system into its major logical components (e.g., API Gateway, Service A, Database, Cache). Shows primary interactions and protocols.]
- **Sequence Diagram(s) for Critical Flows:** [Mandatory. Illustrate step-by-step interactions for: 1. The "happy path" (e.g., successful payment). 2. A critical failure path (e.g., payment declined by provider).]
- **Architecture Decision Record (ADR) Log:** [Link to a log of key decisions. *Example: `ADR-001: Chose gRPC over REST for internal communication for performance reasons.`*]
- **Technology Stack:** [List chosen technologies (e.g., Go 1.22, Gin, PostgreSQL 15, Redis 7) with a brief, assertive justification for each.]

#### **7. Detailed Component Design**
*For each major new or modified component identified in the diagrams:*
- **Component Name:** [e.g., `payment-processor-service`]
- **Responsibility:** [A single, clear sentence. *Example: "Orchestrates payment requests by communicating with third-party payment providers and records transaction outcomes."*]
- **API Contract:** [Link to the definitive, machine-readable API definition in Section 9.]
- **Core Logic (Decision Tables / Pseudocode):** [For complex business rules, use a decision table. For algorithms, use structured, language-agnostic pseudocode. This is a direct input for the AI.]
- **Key Design Patterns:** [Explicitly state patterns to be used. *Example: "Use the Strategy Pattern to abstract payment providers (PayPal, Stripe). Implement the Circuit Breaker pattern for all external API calls."*]
- **Concurrency Model:** [Declare the concurrency strategy. *Example: "The service is stateless and uses goroutines to handle concurrent requests. Max concurrent goroutines for external API calls are limited by a semaphore of size 50."*]
- **State Management:** [Declare where and how state is managed. *Example: "The service is stateless. All persistent state is stored in the PostgreSQL database. Ephemeral session state is stored in Redis with a 15-minute TTL."*]
- **Configuration:** [List all environment variables or config values needed, with descriptions, types, and default/example values. This will generate the `config.yaml` or `.env` template.]

#### **8. Data Architecture & Schema**
- **Logical Data Model / ERD:** [Diagram of entities, attributes, and relationships.]
- **Database Schema (DDL):** [**Mandatory.** Provide the `CREATE TABLE` statements with data types, constraints, and comments. This is a direct input for the AI.]
- **Indexing Strategy:** [Explicitly define indexes. *Example: `CREATE INDEX idx_transactions_user_id ON transactions (user_id);`*]
- **Data Flow Diagram (DFD):** [Show how data, especially PII or sensitive data, moves through the system. This is crucial for security and compliance analysis.]
- **Data Migration Plan:** [Specify the tool (e.g., Flyway, Alembic) and strategy. *Example: "Using Flyway. All schema changes must be backward-compatible and deployed before the application code that uses them."*]
- **Data Governance:** [PII classification, data retention policy, encryption requirements. *Example: "User email is PII and must be encrypted at rest. Transaction records are retained for 7 years and then archived to S3 Glacier."*]

#### **9. API Specification (Contracts)**
- **Public/External APIs (Client-facing):**
  - **Specification:** [**Mandatory.** Provide the complete OpenAPI v3.1 YAML/JSON. This is the source of truth for code generation.]
  - **Authentication/Authorization:** [Specify the exact mechanism. *Example: "Requires an OIDC Bearer token (JWT) issued by `AuthService`. The token must contain the `payments:create` scope."*]
  - **Standard Error Response Schema:** [Define the single, standard error format for all 4xx/5xx responses.]
  - **Rate Limiting Strategy:** [Specify limits and mechanism. *Example: "Implement a token bucket algorithm. Limit is 100 requests/minute per `user_id` and 5000 requests/hour per IP address."*]
  - **Versioning Strategy:** [Declare the API versioning approach. *Example: "Using URI path versioning, e.g., `/v1/payments`."*]
- **Internal APIs (Service-to-service):**
  - **Protocol:** [gRPC, REST, Async (e.g., RabbitMQ, Kafka)]
  - **Specification:** [**Mandatory.** Provide the `.proto` file for gRPC or an OpenAPI spec for REST.]
  - **Service Discovery Mechanism:** [e.g., Kubernetes services, Consul]

### **Part 3: The "What If" — Resilience & Risk Analysis**

#### **10. Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA)**
*Analyze potential failures and define the system's required behavior. This is a primary input for resilience engineering.*
| Failure Scenario | Cause | Likelihood (L/M/H) | Impact (L/M/H) | Detection Mechanism | Automated Response / Fallback |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Downstream DB is unavailable | Network partition, DB crash | L | H | Health check, connection errors | Log critical error. Return HTTP 503. Activate circuit breaker for 60s. |
| External PayPal API is slow | Provider issue | M | M | p99 latency alert on API call duration | Request times out after 1000ms. Log warning. Return HTTP 504. |
| Invalid data from upstream service | Bug in `OrderService` | M | L | Schema validation on ingress | Reject request with HTTP 400 and detailed error log. Alert on `invalid_request_total` metric. |

#### **11. Alternative Solutions Considered**
| Alternative | Description | Pros | Cons | Rejection Rationale |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Buy vs. Build** | Use vendor X vs. building custom logic. | Faster TTM. | Vendor lock-in, lacks feature Y. | Rejected. We require custom reconciliation logic that vendors don't support. |
| **Alt. Tech Stack**| Use Node.js/TypeScript. | Large ecosystem. | Lower raw performance. | Rejected. Technical success criteria require performance of a compiled language. |

#### **12. Risk Assessment & Mitigation**
| Risk Category | Description | Probability (L/M/H) | Impact (L/M/H) | Mitigation Strategy | Owner |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Security** | Secret key for PayPal API is leaked. | L | H | Use HashiCorp Vault with short-lived dynamic secrets. Enforce strict IAM policies. | Security Team |
| **Execution** | Integration with PayPal is more complex than estimated. | M | M | Pre-sprint technical spike. Allocate 20% buffer in project timeline. | Eng Lead |

#### **13. Technical Debt Ledger**
| Identified Debt | Rationale for Incurring | Consequence | Remediation Plan (with Ticket ID) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Generic error messages | Need to ship MVP on time. | Harder for clients to debug issues. | `TECHDEBT-123`: Implement fine-grained error codes in V1.1. |

  Feature: PayPal Payment
    Scenario: Successful payment with a valid account
      Given a user is on the checkout page with items in their cart
      And they are properly authenticated
      When they select PayPal and approve the payment via the mock provider
      Then the system should respond with a 200 OK status
      And the transaction record in the database should have a 'COMPLETED' status
  ```

#### **16. Security & Compliance**

- **Dependency Scanning:** [Specify security checks in the pipeline. *Example: "CI pipeline must include a Trivy scan for OS and library vulnerabilities. Block merges with CRITICAL vulnerabilities."*]
- **Compliance Checklist:** [Checklist of adherence to regulations. *Example: GDPR: No PII in logs. SOC2: All code changes require peer review.*]

#### **17. Observability & Operations**
- **Structured Logging:** [**Mandatory.** Define the JSON log format and key events to log. *Example: `{"level": "info", "timestamp": "...", "service": "payment-processor", "event": "payment_initiated", "trace_id": "...", "user_id": "..."}`*]

- **Release Strategy:** [Canary, Blue-Green? *Example: "Canary release. `phase-1`: 1% traffic for 4 hours. `phase-2`: 10% for 4 hours. `phase-3`: 100%. Monitor error rates at each phase."*]
- **Feature Flags:** [What parts of the feature will be behind a feature flag? *Example: "The entire PayPal option is controlled by the `enable-paypal-checkout` flag in LaunchDarkly."*]
- **Rollback Plan:** [How to roll back? *Example: "Automated rollback in CI/CD if key metric alerts (error rate > 5%) are triggered within 10 minutes of deployment. Manual rollback via re-deploying the previous stable version tag."*]
- **Deprecation Plan:** [If this replaces an old system, detail the sunset plan.]
