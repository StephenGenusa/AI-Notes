Calculating the accuracy of quantized models involves comparing the performance of the quantized model to the original (float) model. Here are the key measurements typically involved in this process:

1. **Accuracy Metrics of the Original Model**: Before quantization, evaluate the original model's performance using relevant metrics (e.g., Top-1/Top-5 accuracy for classification tasks, IoU for object detection, BLEU score for translation, etc.).

2. **Accuracy Metrics of the Quantized Model**: After quantization, evaluate the quantized model using the same metrics as the original model. This direct comparison highlights any performance degradation introduced by quantization.

3. **Accuracy Loss/Gap**: Calculate the difference in accuracy between the original and quantized models. This is often expressed as a percentage point difference (e.g., if the original model has 95% accuracy and the quantized model has 93%, the accuracy loss is 2 percentage points).

4. **Quantization Error**: Measure the numerical differences in model outputs (e.g., logits in classification tasks) between the original and quantized models. Common metrics include:
   - **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: Average absolute difference between original and quantized model outputs.
   - **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: Average squared difference, emphasizing larger discrepancies.
   - **Kullback-Leibler (KL) Divergence**: Measures how the quantized model's output distribution diverges from the original, useful for probabilistic outputs.

5. **Activation and Weight Distribution Analysis**: Examine the distribution of activations and weights in both models. Quantization-aware training or techniques like calibration aim to ensure these distributions are well-represented by the quantized format, minimizing information loss.

6. **Dynamic Range Analysis**: For models using fixed-point quantization, assess whether the dynamic range of the quantized data types (e.g., int8) adequately captures the range of values in the original model. This involves checking for underflow/overflow.

7. **Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR)**: In some contexts, SNR is used to quantify the quality of the quantized model's activations or weights relative to the original, helping to identify if meaningful information is preserved during quantization.

8. **Task-Specific Metrics**: Depending on the application, additional metrics may be critical:
   - **Object Detection**: mAP (mean Average Precision)
   - **Segmentation**: IoU (Intersection over Union), Dice Coefficient
   - **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Perplexity, BLEU score, ROUGE score

9. **Inference Throughput and Latency**: While not a direct measure of accuracy, these performance metrics are crucial for understanding the trade-off between model size, speed, and accuracy. Quantization aims to reduce these metrics without significantly impacting accuracy.

10. **Model Size Reduction**: Measure the reduction in model size achieved through quantization (e.g., from FP32 to INT8, the size typically reduces by a factor of 4). This is an important factor in scenarios where storage or bandwidth is limited.

**Process for Evaluating Quantized Model Accuracy**:

- **Baseline Establishment**: Thoroughly evaluate the original model.
- **Quantize the Model**: Apply quantization techniques (e.g., post-training quantization, quantization-aware training).
- **Re-Evaluation**: Assess the quantized model using the same dataset and metrics.
- **Comparison and Analysis**: Calculate the accuracy loss and analyze quantization errors to understand where and why performance degraded.
- **Iterative Refinement**: Based on analysis, refine the quantization process (e.g., adjust quantization parameters, use more sophisticated quantization techniques) to minimize accuracy loss.

**Tools and Frameworks**: Utilize frameworks like TensorFlow Lite, ONNX Runtime, or PyTorch with quantization support, which often include tools for evaluating quantized model accuracy and provide some of the measurements outlined above.
