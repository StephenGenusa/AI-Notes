## **A Shift in Mindset: From Coder to Conductor**

Welcome to AI-assisted development. This is more than a new set of tools; it's a fundamental shift in the craft of software engineering. For decades, a developer's primary value was in the direct translation of requirements into lines of code. Your expertise was measured in your fluency with syntax and your ability to write complex algorithms from scratch.

That era is evolving.

AI models are now exceptionally good at the "translation" part of the job. They can write boilerplate, implement common algorithms, and scaffold applications in seconds. Attempting to compete with an AI on raw coding speed is a losing battle.

Your value is no longer just in writing code. It is in **directing the creation of code.**

Think of yourself as a conductor leading a world-class orchestra. The AI is your first-chair violinist—a brilliant performer who can play any piece you put in front of them with breathtaking speed and technical skill. But they cannot compose the symphony. They don't know if the piece should be in a major or minor key, what the tempo should be, or how it should connect with the larger performance.

That is your job. You are the conductor, the composer, and the critic. You provide the vision, the structure, and the taste. You set the standard for quality and coherence. This playbook is designed to teach you the art of conducting the AI orchestra, transforming you from a coder into an architect of intelligent systems.

---

## **Your Role: The Architect & Reviewer**

This framework is built on the principle that the human developer acts as the **architect and reviewer**, making strategic decisions and enforcing quality, while the AI acts as a powerful collaborative tool for generation and implementation. Your primary responsibilities are not to write boilerplate, but to:

1.  **Make Strategic Decisions:** Define architectures, choose trade-offs, and set the long-term vision.
2.  **Create Precise Specifications:** Provide the AI with clear, unambiguous instructions and constraints. This is your highest-leverage activity.
3.  **Perform Critical Reviews:** Vigorously inspect all generated artifacts for correctness, quality, and security. You are the final gatekeeper.
4.  **Cultivate Context:** Curate and manage the information the AI uses to ensure its outputs are relevant and consistent with your project.

---

## **Mastering AI Collaboration: The Developer's Guide**

Success with AI-assisted development depends critically on how well you communicate with and guide the AI. This section provides the mental models and concrete techniques to maximize AI effectiveness.

### **Choosing Your AI Collaborator**

Not all AI models are created equal. Your choice of tool will significantly impact your workflow. Consider these factors:

| Factor | Description | Recommendation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Model Specialization** | Some models are generalists (e.g., GPT-4), while others are fine-tuned specifically for code (e.g., Claude 3, Gemini Advanced, Copilot). | For development, prioritize models with strong coding, logic, and reasoning capabilities. A generalist model with top-tier reasoning often outperforms a narrowly-focused code model. |
| **Integration** | Tools can be web-based (Google Gemini, Claude.ai) or integrated directly into your IDE (GitHub Copilot, Codeium). | **Use both.** Use the **IDE integration** for "in-flow" tasks like code completion, refactoring small functions, and generating docstrings. Use the **web-based interface** for "out-of-flow" tasks like architectural design, complex problem-solving, and generating entire components. |
| **Context Window** | This is the amount of information (text and code) the model can "remember" in a single conversation. It ranges from a few thousand tokens to over a million. | A large context window is a superpower. It allows you to provide entire files or TDDs as context, leading to much more relevant and consistent code. Prioritize models with large context windows for complex tasks. |

### **How Prompts Shape AI Responses: A Mental Model**

To write great prompts, you must understand how an LLM "thinks." It doesn't search a database; it navigates a vast, compressed map of concepts learned from its training data. Think of it as a landscape of interconnected ideas, code patterns, and logical structures.

Your prompt acts as a set of coordinates, guiding the AI to a specific region of that map.

*   A **vague prompt** like `"write a server"` provides poor coordinates. The AI lands in a vast, generic "server" territory and gives a generic answer, often a simple Node.js Express app, because that's the statistical center of that region.
*   A **rich prompt** like `"Act as a backend expert. Write a Python FastAPI server endpoint that accepts a Pydantic model for a user profile and saves it to a PostgreSQL database using the repository pattern"` provides precise coordinates. Each term—`FastAPI`, `Pydantic`, `PostgreSQL`, `repository pattern`—activates highly specific, interconnected nodes on the map. The AI is no longer guessing; it's navigating directly to the intersection of these advanced concepts to construct a high-quality, relevant solution.

**Your goal is to become an expert cartographer of the AI's conceptual map.** Every piece of context, every constraint, and every example you provide helps the AI pinpoint the exact location of the solution you need.

### **The Virtuous Cycle: Collaborative Refinement**

AI collaboration is not a single transaction; it's a conversation. Your first prompt yields a first draft. Your feedback on that draft is the most critical step in the process.

Think of it like sculpting:
1.  **Initial Prompt -> The Block of Marble:** The AI gives you a solid, but unrefined, block of code that roughly matches your request.
2.  **Your Feedback -> The Chisel:** You provide specific, targeted feedback. This is not just pointing out mistakes; it's adding new information and constraints. You are carving away what's wrong and sharpening the details of what's right.

`Initial Prompt` → `AI Output v1` → `Your Corrective Feedback` → `AI Output v2 (Better)` → `Your Refining Feedback` → `Final Output v3 (Excellent)`

With each refinement loop, you are doing two things:
*   **Correcting the output:** Fixing the immediate issue.
*   **Enriching the context:** Teaching the AI more about *your specific requirements*. This makes the next generation better, converging more quickly on the ideal solution.

A bad feedback loop: `"That's wrong, try again."`
A powerful feedback loop: `"The logic is sound, but you used a generic `dict`. Please refactor this to use our Pydantic `UserProfile` model for type safety and pass it to the `UserRepository` I provided earlier."`

### **The Anatomy of a Golden Prompt: A Worked Example**

Let's dissect a high-quality prompt to understand its components.

```
(1. Persona) Act as a senior Python developer specializing in performant data processing APIs.

(2. Context) My project uses FastAPI and Pydantic. Here is my core Pydantic model for incoming data:
```python
# models.py
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field
from typing import List

class SalesData(BaseModel):
    transaction_id: str
    product_id: int
    amount_usd: float = Field(gt=0)
    quantity: int = Field(gt=0)
```
And here is the repository class that handles database interaction:
```python
# repository.py
class SalesRepository:
    def bulk_save(self, records: List[SalesData]) -> bool:
        # Complex database logic to save records efficiently
        print(f"Saving {len(records)} records to the database.")
        return True
```
(3. Task) Create a new FastAPI endpoint at `/v1/sales/bulk` that accepts a list of `SalesData` objects. The endpoint should perform basic validation and then pass the list to the `SalesRepository.bulk_save` method.

(4. Constraints & Rules)
- The endpoint must handle request validation errors gracefully, returning a standard 422 error.
- It must respond within 50ms for a typical payload of 100 records.
- Use dependency injection to provide the `SalesRepository` instance.
- Do not write the repository implementation; assume it is provided and works correctly.

(5. Output Format) Return a single, complete Python code block for the main API file. Include all necessary imports.
```

**Breakdown:**
1.  **Persona:** Primes the AI for a specific domain (`performant APIs`), leading to better choices like async handlers.
2.  **Context:** Provides the *exact* code the AI needs to integrate with. This prevents the AI from inventing its own models or classes.
3.  **Task:** A clear, unambiguous instruction of what to build.
4.  **Constraints:** Sets the boundaries. It tells the AI what *not* to do (write repository logic) and defines success criteria (performance, error handling).
5.  **Output Format:** Ensures the response is clean and immediately usable.

This prompt leaves nothing to chance. It guides the AI directly to the optimal solution.

### **The AI Assistance Playbook: From Basic to Advanced**

Use these techniques to construct powerful prompts. Mix and match them as needed.

| Technique | What It Does | Example Prompt |
|---|---|---|
| **Persona Priming** | Activates domain-specific knowledge and conventions by setting a role. | `"Act as a senior DevOps engineer specializing in Kubernetes and AWS..."` |
| **Context Loading** | Grounds the AI in your project's reality by providing relevant code or schemas. | `"Here are my Pydantic models: `[paste models]`. Based on these, generate..."` |
| **Zero-Shot vs. Few-Shot**| Zero-Shot asks directly. Few-Shot provides one or more examples to guide the style and structure. | **Zero-Shot:** `"Translate this Python to Rust."`<br>**Few-Shot:** `"Translate this Python to idiomatic Rust. Follow this example: [Python snippet] becomes [Rust snippet]. Now translate this..."` |
| **Test-First Prompting** | Forces correctness by defining the success criteria (tests) before the implementation. | `"First, write a comprehensive Pytest suite for a function... Then, write the Python function that passes all those tests."` |
| **Chain-of-Thought (CoT)** | Forces the AI to reason step-by-step, improving accuracy for complex logical tasks. | `"My code is failing... Walk me through the code step-by-step, identify the likely cause, and explain your reasoning before suggesting a fix."` |
| **Constraint Fencing** | Prevents undesirable solutions by explicitly stating what *not* to do. | `"Implement the solution in pure Python. Do not use any external libraries like Pandas or NumPy."` |
| **Socratic Self-Correction** | Asks the AI to critique its own output, often revealing flaws you might miss. | `"Review the Python code you just wrote. Identify three potential security vulnerabilities and suggest how to mitigate them."` |
| **Output Structuring** | Controls the format of the response for consistency and easy parsing. | `"Generate the solution in a JSON format with three keys: 'python_code', 'unit_tests', and 'dependencies_list'."` |
| **Knowledge Anchoring** | Leverages the AI's training on well-known patterns, books, or architectural styles. | `"Refactor this class to follow the SOLID principles. For each change, reference which principle it adheres to."` |
| **Problem Reframing** | Breaks through a creative or logical block by asking the AI to look at the problem differently. | `"We're struggling to optimize this database query... What are three alternative approaches we haven't considered?"` |

### **Context Management**

The AI's context window is your workspace. Use it strategically. An overstuffed, noisy context is as bad as a missing one. Constrain your inputs to the AI to just what it needs to see. Constrain the output of the AI to just what you need to see.

```python
# OPTIMAL: Curated, relevant context
"""
Current system uses this base class for all API endpoints:
[paste BaseEndpoint class - 20 lines]

Our standard error response format:
[paste ErrorResponse Pydantic model - 10 lines]

Create a new endpoint that follows these patterns for user authentication. The endpoint should accept an email and password and return a JWT.
"""

# SUBOPTIMAL: Context overload (the "kitchen sink" approach)
"""
Here's a file with all our models, another with all our utils, and our main server file: 
[paste 10,000 lines of code]
Add user authentication in.
"""
```
**Rule of thumb:** Provide the minimum context necessary for the AI to make an informed decision.

### **The Specification Hierarchy**

Structure your specifications from general to specific. This naturally builds the context for the AI.

1.  **Project Context**: "We're building a real-time analytics dashboard for e-commerce sales."
2.  **Component Purpose**: "This module is the data ingestion service. It listens to a Kafka topic for 'OrderCreated' events."
3.  **Technical Constraints**: "Must process 10K messages/second with an average latency under 50ms. Use Python with the `aiokafka` library."
4.  **Integration Points**: "It will deserialize the event using our `OrderSchema` Pydantic model and then call the `MetricsStore.increment()` method."
5.  **Specific Task**: "Implement the `consume_and_transform` method. It should include robust error handling for deserialization failures and connection issues to the MetricsStore."

### **Common Pitfalls and Solutions**

| Pitfall | Symptom | Solution |
|---|---|---|
| **Ambiguous Requirements** | AI makes incorrect assumptions or provides generic code. | Use the **Specification Hierarchy** and provide concrete examples (**Few-Shot Prompting**). |
| **Missing Context** | AI reinvents existing patterns or uses incompatible styles. | Use **Context Loading** with curated, relevant code snippets. |
| **Overly Broad Prompts** | AI generates an unfocused or over-engineered solution. | Break down the problem. Use **Test-First Prompting** for a specific function. |
| **Implicit Expectations** | AI doesn't match your style, naming, or desired patterns. | Use **Persona Priming**, **Few-Shot Prompting**, and **Knowledge Anchoring**. |
| **Context Pollution** | AI gets confused by irrelevant information from a long chat history. | Start a new conversation or explicitly tell the AI to ignore previous instructions. Curate your context. |
| **Hallucinations & Bugs** | AI produces plausible but incorrect code, or invents non-existent library functions. | Force detailed reasoning with **Chain-of-Thought** and use the **Developer's Verification Checklist**. Never trust, always verify. |

---

## **The Human-in-the-Loop: Verification and Trust**

An AI collaborator can write code, but it cannot exercise judgment. It has no understanding of consequences. This makes the human role of diligent verification the most important function in the entire development loop.

### **Principle 1: Never Trust, Always Verify**

Treat every line of AI-generated code as if it were written by a brilliant, fast, but occasionally careless junior developer. It might be perfect, or it might contain subtle bugs, security holes, or performance nightmares. The AI's confidence in its own output is not a reliable signal of its quality. **You are the quality gate.**

### **Principle 2: The Developer's Verification Checklist**

When reviewing AI-generated code, do not just check if it "looks right." Systematically evaluate it against a mental checklist.

*   **[ ] Correctness:** Does the code actually solve the problem specified? Does it handle all edge cases mentioned in the prompt (e.g., empty lists, null values, invalid inputs)? Run the tests.
*   **[ ] Security:** Does the code introduce vulnerabilities? Check for common issues like SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), insecure direct object references, or improper handling of secrets. Ask the AI to self-correct for security flaws.
*   **[ ] Performance:** Is the code efficient? Look for anti-patterns like N+1 query problems in database loops, inefficient in-memory processing of large datasets, or blocking I/O calls in asynchronous code.
*   **[ ] Readability & Style:** Does the code match your project's style guide? Is it clear, well-commented, and easy for another human to understand and maintain?
*   **[ ] Dependency Hallucinations:** Did the AI invent a library, module, or function that doesn't exist? Always verify imports and function calls against official documentation.
*   **[ ] Integration:** Does the code correctly use the interfaces and data models from your existing codebase (which you provided as context)?

---

## **Security, Privacy, and Intellectual Property**

Engaging with a third-party AI model requires extreme discipline regarding data privacy and IP protection.

### **The "Public Forum" Rule**

Treat every prompt you send to a public AI model (like ChatGPT, Claude, etc.) as if you were posting it on a public forum like Stack Overflow. Most general-purpose models use user-submitted data for future training unless you use a specific business-tier service with data privacy guarantees.

### **Protecting Proprietary Code**

*   **DO NOT** paste large blocks of sensitive, proprietary source code into a public AI tool.
*   **DO NOT** paste customer data, internal API keys, passwords, or other secrets into a prompt.
*   **DO** anonymize and abstract your code before using it as context. Instead of pasting your entire user class, create a simplified, generic version that shows the structure without revealing business logic.
    *   **Bad:** Pasting your `ProprietaryBillingAlgorithm` class.
    *   **Good:** Pasting a generic `class DataProcessor { process(data) { /* ... */ } }` and explaining what it does in plain English.

### **Understanding Output Ownership**

The legal landscape around code generated by AI is still evolving. Consult your company's policy. In general, you are responsible for the code you commit, regardless of whether you or an AI wrote it. This reinforces the principle of **Never Trust, Always Verify.**

---

## **The Core Development Loop**

All development in this framework follows a simple, repeatable four-step loop. This loop applies at every level of abstraction: for the overall architecture, for each component, and for the integrated system.

**`Specify -> Generate -> Review -> Refine`**

1.  **Specify:** You, the human architect, define the requirements, constraints, and success criteria with a high-quality prompt.
2.  **Generate:** The AI collaborator generates the code, tests, or documentation based on your precise specification.
3.  **Review:** You critically evaluate the AI's output against your specification, using the **Developer's Verification Checklist** and your own expertise.
4.  **Refine:** You provide targeted feedback to the AI to correct flaws, or you manually refactor the code to meet the standard. This is the "virtuous cycle" in action.

---

## **Setting the Rigor Dial & Choosing Your Path**

Before you begin, determine the appropriate level of rigor and your starting point.

#### **Level 1: Prototype (Low Rigor)**
*   **Goal:** Rapidly validate a single idea.
*   **Process:** Generate a working script, evaluate it, and move on.
*   **Go To: Phase 0: Rapid Prototyping**

#### **Level 3: Feature (Medium Rigor)**
*   **Goal:** Add a well-defined feature to an existing system.
*   **Process:** Focus on component-level development and clean integration.
*   **Go To: Phase 2: Component-Level Development**

#### **Level 5: Production System (High Rigor)**
*   **Goal:** Build a new, robust system from the ground up.
*   **Your starting point depends on whether you have a Technical Design Document (TDD).**

    *   **If you do NOT have a pre-existing TDD:** Your first goal is to create the architectural blueprint.
        *   **Go To: Phase 1: Conceptualization & Architectural Design**

    *   **If you DO have a pre-existing TDD:** Your TDD serves as the master specification. You can begin implementation immediately.
        *   **Go To: Phase 2: Component-Level Development**

---

## **Phase 0: Rapid Prototyping (Low Rigor)**

**Objective:** Quickly validate ideas and build functional prototypes for well-scoped problems.

### **Step 0.1: Single-Shot Prototype (Specify & Generate)**
```
I need a working prototype for [specific description]. 

Requirements:
- Core functionality: [what it must do]
- Language: [language]
- External dependencies: [any specific libraries/APIs]

Generate a single file solution that implements the core functionality end-to-end with at least 3 usage examples. Keep it under 300 lines and focus on working code over perfect architecture.
```

### **Step 0.2: Review & Refine**
Evaluate the prototype (using the Verification Checklist lightly). If it needs expansion, use it as a spike and proceed to the appropriate high-rigor phase. If it's sufficient as-is, use the following prompt to productionize it.
```
The prototype works. Now add:
1. A command-line interface.
2. Configuration file support.
3. Structured logging and robust error handling.
4. A comprehensive README.
```

---

## **Phase 1: Conceptualization & Architectural Design**
**(For Projects WITHOUT a Pre-existing TDD)**

**Objective:** Transform high-level goals into a concrete, validated architectural blueprint (your TDD) before writing significant code.

### **Step 1.0: De-risk with a Spike (Specify & Validate)**
For novel or complex requirements, validate a core technical assumption with a minimal prototype.
```
Act as a principal engineer. We need to validate: [Describe the single most complex or uncertain technical challenge].

Generate a minimal, runnable code "spike" in [language] that proves we can [achieve the specific outcome]. Focus only on proving the core mechanism works. Include key takeaways about performance, complexity, or limitations discovered.
```

### **Step 1.1: Generate the Architectural Blueprint (Generate)**
```
Act as a senior software architect. Based on the following requirements, generate a comprehensive architectural blueprint:

Project goal: [Brief, specific description]
Key Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs): [Performance, security, scalability, etc.]
Key functional requirements: [3-5 core functions]
[If spike was performed]: Based on our spike findings: [paste key takeaways]

Please provide:
1. A logical directory structure with all necessary files.
2. Interface definitions for all major components (e.g., abstract base classes, protocol definitions).
3. Data models (e.g., Pydantic models, database schemas) with field definitions and types.
4. A dependency diagram or text description of component relationships.
5. Recommended design patterns with justification.
6. A recommended implementation sequence that respects dependencies.
```

### **Step 1.2: Human Review and Refinement (Review & Refine)**
Critically review the generated architecture. Then, use this prompt to refine it.
```
I've reviewed the architecture and have the following concerns/questions:
[List specific questions or concerns regarding cohesion, coupling, testability, scalability, etc.]

Please revise the blueprint to address these issues. For each change, explain why it improves the architecture.
```
*At the end of this phase, you will have a robust architectural document, equivalent to a TDD, ready for implementation.*

---

## **Phase 2: Component-Level Development**
**(For ALL Medium & High Rigor Projects)**

**Objective:** Implement each component in isolation, ensuring it is correct and robust before integration.

### **Step 2.1: Establish Component Specification (Specify)**

Your approach here depends on your starting point.

*   **Path A (If you do NOT have a TDD): Create a Specification**
    Use the AI to detail the component's contract based on the architecture from Phase 1.
    ```
    I'm implementing the [Component Name] from our architecture. Before writing code, please create a detailed specification including:
    1. The exact purpose and responsibilities of this component.
    2. A complete interface definition (methods, params, returns, exceptions).
    3. All expected behaviors, key algorithms, and edge cases to handle.
    ```
*   **Path B (If you DO have a TDD): Extract Specification from TDD**
    Provide the AI with the relevant TDD section as the source of truth.
    ```
    Act as a senior developer implementing a system from a Technical Design Document. I am providing the specification for [Component Name] directly from our TDD.

    **TDD Specification for [Component Name]:**
    ---
    [Paste the relevant section from your TDD, including purpose, interface, dependencies, logic, and error conditions.]
    ---

    Confirm you have understood this specification and are ready to proceed with implementation.
    ```

### **Step 2.2: Implementation from Specification (Generate)**
```
Based on the specification for [Component Name] established in the previous step, generate:

1.  A complete test suite that validates all specified requirements, behaviors, and error conditions.
2.  The implementation code that satisfies these tests, following [Language] best practices.

Generate two separate code blocks: first the test file, then the implementation file.
```

### **Step 2.3: Code Review and Refinement (Review & Refine)**
Examine the generated code and tests against the specification using the **Developer's Verification Checklist**.
```
I've reviewed the code for [Component Name] and found these issues:
1. [Security]: The SQL query is built using string formatting, creating an injection vulnerability. Please refactor to use parameterized queries.
2. [Correctness]: The method [method name] doesn't handle the divide-by-zero edge case specified in the TDD.
3. [Style]: The test for [behavior] should use our `MockRepository` fixture instead of a generic MagicMock.

Please revise the implementation and tests to address these concerns.
```

### **Step 2.4: Incremental Integration**
After implementing related components, validate them together.
```
I've implemented [Component A] and [Component B] according to their specifications. Generate comprehensive integration tests that verify:
1. The primary happy path workflow involving both components.
2. Correct error propagation when [Component A] fails and [Component B] must handle that failure.
```
---

## **Phase 3: System Integration and Optimization**

**Objective:** Ensure all components work together as a cohesive system and optimize for production.

### **Step 3.1: Architectural Reality Check (Review)**
Compare the final implementation against the initial design.
```
We have now implemented the core components. Analyze the code against our original architectural blueprint and identify:
1. **Design-Reality Gaps**: Where did the implementation deviate from the plan? Why?
2. **Required Updates**: Propose concrete updates to our design document to reflect the as-built system.
```

### **Step 3.2: End-to-End Implementation (Generate & Refine)**
Create the application's entry point.
```
Help me create the main application entry point that:
1. Initializes all components using a dependency injection container.
2. Implements the primary server/application loop.
3. Includes production concerns like health check endpoints and graceful shutdown signals.
```

### **Step 3.3: System-Level Testing and Observability (Generate)**
```
Generate a comprehensive observability and testing strategy for the complete system:
1. **Observability**: Add structured logging to all key API paths. Suggest key metrics (e.g., request latency, error rate) to export for Prometheus. Define critical trace spans.
2. **End-to-End Tests**: Generate Playwright or Selenium tests for the 3 most critical user journeys.
```

### **Step 3.4: Documentation and Refinement (Refine)**
Generate final documentation based on the complete, working system.
```
Based on the implemented system, generate production-ready documentation:
1. **README.md**: An overview, an updated architecture diagram (in MermaidJS format), and a quick start guide.
2. **API Documentation**: Generate an OpenAPI/Swagger specification from our FastAPI code.
3. **Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)**: Create an ADR for the decision to use [e.g., PostgreSQL instead of MongoDB], explaining the context, decision, and consequences.
```

### **Step 3.5: Optimization (Review & Refine)**
```
Review the complete implementation and suggest optimizations, prioritized by impact vs. effort, in these areas:
1. Performance (bottlenecks, caching)
2. Resource Usage (memory, connections)
3. Code Quality (refactoring, simplification)
4. Reliability (circuit breakers, retry logic)
```

## **Appendix A: Prompting Techniques Quick Reference**

| Technique | What It Does |
|---|---|
| **Persona Priming** | Activates domain-specific knowledge and conventions by setting a role. |
| **Context Loading** | Grounds the AI in your project's reality by providing relevant code or schemas. |
| **Zero-Shot vs. Few-Shot**| Zero-Shot asks directly. Few-Shot provides examples to guide style and structure. |
| **Test-First Prompting** | Forces correctness by defining the success criteria (tests) before the implementation. |
| **Chain-of-Thought (CoT)** | Forces the AI to reason step-by-step, improving accuracy for complex logical tasks. |
| **Constraint Fencing** | Prevents undesirable solutions by explicitly stating what *not* to do. |
| **Socratic Self-Correction** | Asks the AI to critique its own output, often revealing flaws you might miss. |
| **Output Structuring** | Controls the format of the response for consistency and easy parsing. |
| **Knowledge Anchoring** | Leverages the AI's training on well-known patterns, books, or architectural styles. |
| **Problem Reframing** | Breaks through a creative or logical block by asking the AI to look at the problem differently. |
