# Comprehensive LLM Comparison Frameworks in Python

There are several Python frameworks designed specifically for evaluating and comparing LLM models across different quantization levels (like BF16 vs Q8 vs Q2) both mathematically and on NLP tasks. Here are the most comprehensive options:

## 1. LM Evaluation Harness (Eleuther AI)

The [LM Evaluation Harness](https://github.com/EleutherAI/lm-evaluation-harness) is perhaps the most comprehensive open-source framework for this purpose.

**Key features:**
- Supports 200+ evaluation tasks
- Handles different model quantizations
- Tests knowledge domains from science to reasoning
- Tracks mathematical accuracy
- Long-context evaluation capabilities
- Built specifically for comparing model variants

## 2. HELM (Holistic Evaluation of Language Models)

Stanford's [HELM](https://github.com/stanford-crfm/helm) is designed explicitly for holistic comparison:

**Key features:**
- Tests both accuracy and precision limitations
- Focuses on revealing quantization artifacts
- Includes numerical stability challenges
- Comprehensive metrics across domains
- Detailed failure analysis

## 3. OpenCompass

[OpenCompass](https://github.com/open-compass/opencompass) evaluates LLMs across quantization levels:

**Key features:**
- 100+ datasets and 1000+ test scenarios
- Specific support for quantized models comparison
- Evaluates hallucinations and factual correctness
- Long-context specific benchmarks
- Mathematical precision tests

## 4. RAGAS

[RAGAS](https://github.com/explodinggradients/ragas) focuses on precision-sensitive RAG applications:

**Key features:**
- Evaluates factual consistency
- Tests numerical stability in different quantization levels
- Specific to knowledge-intensive tasks
- Reveals precision limitations

## 5. TruLens

[TruLens](https://github.com/truera/trulens) is designed for fine-grained analysis:

**Key features:**
- Built for A/B testing different model variants
- Evaluates hallucinations and numerical correctness
- Provides detailed comparison reports
- Specifically designed to highlight quantization differences
