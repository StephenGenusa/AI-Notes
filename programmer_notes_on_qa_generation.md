## Corpus Preparation

### 1. Ensure corpus quality

- **Use well-written, factually accurate, and authoritative texts**: Begin by sourcing materials from reputable publishers, academic institutions, and recognized experts in the field. Implement verification procedures using tools like `scholarly-py` to check citation metrics or `beautifulsoup4` to scrape publication metadata. Establish a scoring system (1-5) for source reliability, prioritizing peer-reviewed journals, textbooks from established publishers, and official documentation. For web content, consider domain authority metrics using SEO tools like `moz-api-wrapper` or `semrush-api`. Cross-reference factual claims across multiple sources using information extraction tools like `spaCy` or `NLTK` to identify contradictions. Create a preprocessing pipeline that flags potentially outdated information using publication dates and citation analysis. Consider implementing a "fact verification" module using tools like `fever-api` or a custom implementation with `transformers` to validate factual statements against established knowledge bases.

- **Prioritize diverse and representative source materials**: Create a systematic sampling strategy that ensures balanced representation across different publication types, time periods, and perspectives. Use topic modeling with `gensim` or `scikit-learn` (LDA, NMF) to identify thematic coverage and detect gaps. Calculate diversity metrics using entropy measures on topic distributions. Develop corpus-level metadata that tracks source demographics, including geographical origin, publication date, author diversity, and institutional affiliation. Implement representativeness checks that compare your corpus distribution against known field distributions using statistical tests (chi-square, KL-divergence) available in `scipy.stats`. Address identified gaps by specifically sourcing underrepresented perspectives, potentially using search APIs like `google-search`, `arxiv`, or `crossref` with targeted queries. Consider using clustering algorithms (`HDBSCAN`, `K-means`) to visualize your corpus diversity and identify blind spots. Maintain a "diversity index" that quantitatively measures how balanced your corpus is across key dimensions relevant to your domain.

### 2. Clean the data thoroughly

- **Remove irrelevant content, formatting artifacts, and duplicate information**: Implement a multi-stage cleaning pipeline using `pandas` and `regex` to systematically identify and remove boilerplate text, headers/footers, navigation elements, and advertisements. Use libraries like `html2text` or `beautifulsoup4` to strip HTML formatting while preserving semantic structure. Develop custom regular expressions to catch common formatting artifacts like multiple spaces, inconsistent line breaks, and special characters. Implement fuzzy matching with `fuzzywuzzy` or `rapidfuzz` to detect near-duplicate content with similarity thresholds (e.g., 90%+), and retain only the most comprehensive version. Use windowed n-gram analysis to detect redundant information within documents that rephrases the same content. Apply sentence-level deduplication using embedding similarity (via `sentence-transformers`) to remove repetitive statements across different sections. Develop domain-specific cleaning rules for common artifacts in your field (e.g., citation markers, equation numbering). Track all transformations in a cleaning log to maintain data provenance and enable reversal if needed.

- **Apply consistent normalization techniques**: Create a normalization pipeline using `nltk`, `spaCy`, or custom regex that standardizes text representation across your corpus. Implement configurable case normalization (typically lowercase for most NLP tasks, but preserve proper nouns using NER). Standardize spacing with regex to ensure consistent single spaces between words and appropriate paragraph breaks. Normalize quotation marks, apostrophes, and other punctuation to their standard Unicode representations using character mapping dictionaries. Handle special characters consistently by either removing, replacing with standard equivalents, or preserving them based on domain requirements. Implement number and date format standardization using libraries like `dateparser` and custom regex patterns. For technical content, standardize units of measurement, chemical formulas, or mathematical notation using domain-specific normalization libraries (e.g., `sympy` for mathematical expressions). Apply unicode normalization (typically NFKC form) using Python's `unicodedata` module to handle combining characters and variants. Document all normalization decisions in a style guide to ensure consistency across your entire pipeline.

### 3. Segment appropriately

- **Break text into logical units for targeted Q&A generation**: Develop an intelligent segmentation pipeline that respects the natural boundaries of information in your corpus. Implement sentence segmentation using `spaCy` or `nltk.sent_tokenize()` with custom post-processing for domain-specific patterns (e.g., handling abbreviations, bullet points). Create paragraph-level segmentation using formatting cues and semantic coherence measures. Implement sliding window approaches with configurable overlap (typically 10-30%) using `more_itertools.windowed_complete` to handle cross-boundary information. Develop semantic segmentation that detects topic shifts using embedding changes (cosine distance between consecutive segments using `sentence-transformers`), TextTiling algorithms (`nltk.TextTiling`), or transformer-based segmentation models like `longformer` for detecting natural breakpoints. For technical content, recognize section types (definitions, examples, procedures) using rule-based patterns or classifiers trained on labeled examples with `scikit-learn`. Adjust segment size based on the complexity of the content, using readability metrics (`textstat`) to ensure segments remain comprehensible units. Implement validations to prevent overly short segments (<50 words) or excessively long ones (>500 words) that might be unsuitable for Q&A generation.

- **Maintain document structure to preserve hierarchical relationships**: Develop parsers for common document formats (PDF, DOCX, HTML) using libraries like `pdfplumber`, `python-docx`, or `beautifulsoup4` that capture structural elements including headers, subheaders, lists, tables, and figures. Implement a document object model that preserves the hierarchical nesting of sections and subsections. Create explicit parent-child relationships between segments using a tree data structure (e.g., `anytree`) that maintains the original document organization. Extract and normalize heading levels to create consistent section numbering. Preserve reference relationships between segments by tracking cross-references, citations, and contextual dependencies. For each segment, maintain metadata about its position in the hierarchy, including breadcrumbs to parent sections. When generating questions, include context awareness by providing access to parent section information. Design your database schema (using `SQLAlchemy` or NoSQL solutions like `MongoDB`) to represent these hierarchical relationships efficiently. Implement visualization tools using libraries like `networkx` or `plotly` to inspect and validate the preserved document structure.

### 4. Diversify content

- **Include various topics, difficulty levels, and perspectives**: Implement systematic content diversification by first analyzing your existing corpus using topic modeling (`gensim.models.LdaModel` or `BERTopic`) to identify coverage gaps. Create a specification matrix that maps required topics against difficulty levels (e.g., beginner, intermediate, advanced) and establish minimum thresholds for each combination. Develop or use difficulty estimation algorithms that assess linguistic complexity (using `textstat` for readability metrics), vocabulary rarity (using word frequency lists), and conceptual density (using keyword clustering). Implement perspective diversity by identifying stance and viewpoint using sentiment analysis (`vaderSentiment`, `textblob`) and more sophisticated stance detection models built with `transformers`. Actively source content that presents alternative viewpoints on controversial topics. Create a tracking system that quantifies diversity across these dimensions and alerts when certain categories fall below defined thresholds. Build targeted search tools using Python APIs for academic databases and content aggregators to systematically fill identified gaps. Consider implementing a weighted sampling approach during Q&A generation that prioritizes underrepresented content categories.

- **Balance representation across different domains and knowledge areas**: Establish a formal knowledge taxonomy for your target domain using existing ontologies (e.g., DBpedia, domain-specific ontologies) or create a custom one using hierarchical clustering on your corpus. Map each document to relevant knowledge areas using classification algorithms (`scikit-learn`'s SVM or Random Forest classifiers, or fine-tuned `transformers` models). Calculate representation metrics for each knowledge area, considering both document count and word count. Implement balancing strategies like oversampling underrepresented areas during Q&A generation or applying weights that normalize representation during training. For interdisciplinary content, develop multi-label classification to capture cross-domain relationships. Create visualization dashboards using `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, or interactive tools like `plotly` to monitor knowledge distribution. Implement regular audit procedures that compare your corpus distribution against established knowledge bases or curricula in your field. Develop targeted acquisition strategies for underrepresented domains using specialized search queries and source identification.

### 5. Handle domain-specific terminology

- **Create glossaries or dedicated sections for specialized vocabulary**: Build an automated terminology extraction pipeline using statistical methods (TF-IDF, C-value/NC-value) and linguistic patterns with `spaCy` to identify domain-specific terms. Supplement with existing terminology databases and ontologies from your field. Develop contextual definition extraction using pattern matching with `regex` and dependency parsing to identify explanatory sentences or parenthetical definitions within the corpus. Implement term clustering to group related concepts using semantic similarity of embeddings from models like `sentence-transformers`. Generate comprehensive glossary entries for each term that include the definition, usage examples, related terms, and source citations. Consider using controlled vocabularies like SKOS to structure relationships between terms. Build specialized term disambiguation functionality using word sense disambiguation techniques and contextual embeddings when terms have multiple meanings. Maintain term frequency statistics to identify core vocabulary versus specialized terms. Integrate the glossary with the Q&A generation system to allow specialized questions that test terminology understanding.

- **Ensure consistent treatment of technical terms across the corpus**: Implement term normalization using a combination of rule-based replacement and fuzzy matching to identify variant forms of the same technical concept. Create abbreviation detection and expansion using pattern matching and context analysis with libraries like `scispacy` (for scientific text). Build a canonical term database that maps variants to preferred forms. Develop co-reference resolution specifically tuned for technical terms using domain-adapted models or rule-based approaches that recognize definitional patterns. Implement consistency checks that flag inconsistent usage of the same term across different documents or sections. For domain-specific entities (e.g., chemical compounds, gene names), integrate specialized NER models or use existing domain ontologies with entity linkers. Track term context vectors using embeddings to identify potential semantic drift across the corpus. Consider implementing term versioning for evolving technical concepts, identifying when definitions change over time. Build visualization tools that show term relationship networks and highlight inconsistencies in usage or definition across the corpus.

## Question Generation Strategies

### 1. Vary question types

- **Factual/recall questions for testing basic comprehension**: Implement a systematic approach to generating factual questions by first extracting key entities, relationships, and events from your text using NER and dependency parsing with `spaCy` or `stanza`. Create question templates for different fact types (e.g., who, what, when, where templates) that leverage the grammatical structure of statements. Use subject-verb-object extraction to transform declarative sentences into interrogatives by moving the verb, adding auxiliary verbs, and inserting appropriate question words. Implement answer-aware question generation by first identifying important answer candidates (named entities, dates, quantities, technical terms) and then constructing questions around them. Utilize the QA-SRL framework (Question-Answer Driven Semantic Role Labeling) to generate questions based on predicate-argument structures. For domain-specific facts, create specialized templates that target key attributes and properties (e.g., "What is the melting point of X?" for chemistry). Track question distribution across fact types to ensure balanced coverage. Consider implementing roundtrip consistency checking by using QA models like `transformers` pipeline('question-answering') to verify if generated questions reliably yield the intended answers.

- **Inferential questions requiring synthesis of information**: Develop more sophisticated question generation techniques that require connecting multiple pieces of information across sentences or paragraphs. Implement co-reference resolution using `neuralcoref` or `spaCy`'s experimental coref component to identify information about the same entity spread across text. Use discourse parsing to identify causal, temporal, and logical relationships between statements that can form the basis for synthesis questions. Implement relation extraction to identify connected entities and events that span multiple sentences. Train or fine-tune sequence-to-sequence models like `t5-base` or `bart-large` on datasets like HotpotQA to generate multi-hop reasoning questions. Create contrast and comparison templates that require synthesizing information about multiple entities or concepts. Implement approaches to identify definitional content and conceptual explanations that can be transformed into "Why" or "How" questions. Use entailment pairs from the text to generate inference questions where the answer requires logical deduction. Validate generated inferential questions by checking that the required information spans multiple sentences or text chunks, and ensure the answer cannot be found verbatim in the text.

- **Hypothetical/counterfactual questions to test reasoning**: Implement advanced question generation strategies that test deeper understanding by creating hypothetical scenarios. Use conditional statement extraction to identify if-then relationships in the text that can be transformed into counterfactual questions by negating or modifying conditions. Develop templates for scenario-based questions that adapt factual content into hypothetical contexts (e.g., "What would happen if X were changed to Y?"). Implement entity property extraction to identify key attributes that can be modified in hypothetical scenarios. For scientific or technical content, create controlled variable modification questions that test understanding of causal relationships. Use negation and contradiction generation to transform factual statements into counterfactual questions. Consider implementing a hybrid approach where GPT-3.5/4 via the OpenAI API is prompted to generate counterfactual scenarios based on extracted key facts, with appropriate constraints to ensure domain relevance and factual grounding. Validate hypothetical questions by ensuring they remain answerable from the principles and relationships described in the text, even if the specific scenario is novel. Track complexity metrics for these questions to ensure they remain accessible while testing reasoning.

- **Open-ended discussion questions for nuanced understanding**: Develop algorithms for generating thought-provoking questions that encourage exploration of concepts rather than single correct answers. Identify debated topics, limitations, and areas of uncertainty in the text using linguistic cues (hedging words, contrasting viewpoints, mentioned limitations) and transform these into open questions. Implement controversy detection to find topics where multiple viewpoints are presented. Extract ethical implications, applications, or future directions mentioned in the text to create forward-looking questions. Train a classifier to identify sections containing nuanced, multi-faceted content suitable for discussion questions. Use topic and subtopic extraction to generate questions about relationships between concepts or comparing approaches. Implement evaluation perspective questions that ask for assessment of strengths, weaknesses, or relative importance. For each open-ended question, provide possible discussion points or evaluation criteria to guide response evaluation. Validate that these questions cannot be answered with simple factual statements by using complexity metrics and ensuring they map to Bloom's taxonomy levels of analysis, evaluation, or creation. Consider implementing reflection triggers that ask about personal experience, applications, or connections to broader contexts.

- **Multi-hop reasoning questions that draw from multiple sections**: Develop specialized techniques for creating questions that require integrating information across distant parts of a document or multiple documents. Implement cross-document entity linking to identify when the same concepts appear in different sections. Create a knowledge graph representation of your corpus using libraries like `networkx` or `neo4j` to identify multi-step paths between entities that can form reasoning chains. Develop templates specifically for bridge questions that require connecting information through intermediate concepts. Implement causal chain extraction to identify sequences of events or processes that span multiple sections. Use transformer-based models like `t5-base` fine-tuned on multi-hop datasets (e.g., HotpotQA, ComplexWebQuestions) to generate questions requiring multiple reasoning steps. Develop section boundary awareness by tracking which information appears in which document sections and purposefully generating questions that bridge these boundaries. Create validation mechanisms that trace the reasoning path required to answer each question, ensuring it spans multiple sections and requires 2+ inferential steps. Track the "hop count" required for each question as a complexity metric. Implement difficulty controls that allow generating questions with specific numbers of reasoning steps.

### 2. Balance question complexity

- **Simple single-fact extraction questions**: Implement a systematic approach to creating straightforward factual questions that serve as foundational knowledge checks. Use dependency parsing with `spaCy` to identify simple subject-verb-object structures that can be directly transformed into questions. Focus on key entities, dates, locations, and quantities that are clearly stated in single sentences. Develop templates for common fact patterns (e.g., "Who discovered X?", "When did Y occur?", "What is the definition of Z?"). Use named entity recognition to extract important terms, people, organizations, and locations that should be covered by basic questions. Implement answer importance ranking using metrics like term frequency, position in text, or presence in headings to prioritize questions about central facts. Create a difficulty scoring system that classifies questions as "simple" based on features like sentence complexity, vocabulary level, and inference requirements. Implement roundtrip verification to ensure generated questions have unambiguous answers clearly stated in the text. Track the proportion of simple questions to maintain an appropriate distribution (typically 30-40% for balanced datasets). Create specialized templates for domain-specific factual questions (e.g., scientific constants, historical dates, definitional questions) that target essential knowledge in your field.

- **Medium complexity requiring paragraph comprehension**: Develop techniques for generating questions that require understanding an entire paragraph or short section, rather than just extracting a single fact. Implement paragraph summarization using models like `bart-large-cnn` to identify the central claims and supporting details that can serve as question targets. Create templates for questions that test understanding of relationships between multiple sentences (e.g., cause-effect, compare-contrast, problem-solution patterns). Use discourse parsing to identify rhetorical structures within paragraphs that can be transformed into questions about the author's purpose, evidence used, or conclusions drawn. Implement anaphora and coreference resolution to create questions that test understanding of entity relationships across multiple sentences. Develop techniques for questions about implied information that isn't explicitly stated but can be inferred from the paragraph. Create medium-complexity templates that ask about main ideas, supporting details, purpose, or sequence of events within a paragraph. Implement paragraph-level importance scoring to identify the most information-rich sections for question generation. Use readability metrics and syntactic complexity measures to classify questions as medium difficulty. Track the distribution of medium complexity questions, typically aiming for 40-50% of your dataset.

- **Complex reasoning across multiple sections**: Implement advanced question generation that requires integrating and synthesizing information from different parts of a document. Create a document graph representation that captures relationships between sections, topics, and concepts. Use topic modeling and semantic similarity to identify related concepts that appear in different sections but are conceptually linked. Develop templates for comparison questions that require evaluating similarities and differences between ideas presented in separate sections. Implement causal chain extraction that spans section boundaries to create questions about sequences of events or processes. Use transformer models fine-tuned on multi-hop reasoning datasets to generate questions requiring integration of distant information. Create templates for synthesis questions that ask about overarching themes, patterns, or conclusions across the entire document. Implement validation checks that verify questions require information from at least 2-3 different sections to answer correctly. Develop difficulty scoring that considers factors like the number of reasoning steps, the conceptual distance between information pieces, and the abstraction level required. Track the proportion of complex questions, typically limiting them to 10-20% of the dataset to maintain appropriate difficulty distribution.

- **Parameterize generation to control this distribution**: Implement a configurable question generation system that allows precise control over the complexity distribution. Create a question complexity classifier using features like sentence structure, vocabulary difficulty, reasoning steps required, and information span (single sentence, paragraph, multi-section). Use this classifier to tag generated questions by difficulty level. Develop a sampling mechanism that selects questions according to a target distribution (e.g., 35% simple, 45% medium, 20% complex). Implement a configuration interface that allows adjusting these parameters based on the intended use case of the dataset. Create complexity metrics for each question type and track their distribution using visualization tools like `matplotlib` or `plotly`. Implement adaptive generation that can dynamically adjust complexity based on topic, domain, or document characteristics. Build validation tools that verify the actual complexity distribution matches the intended parameters. Create evaluation metrics that assess whether questions at each complexity level appropriately test the intended reasoning skills. Develop domain-specific complexity adjustments that account for field-specific knowledge requirements. Consider implementing user feedback mechanisms that allow refining complexity classification based on actual difficulty experienced by users.

### 3. Consider linguistic diversity

- **Use different question words (who, what, why, how, etc.)**: Implement a systematic approach to ensure variety in question phrasings by first analyzing your content to identify potential question types. Create a comprehensive taxonomy of question forms including factual (who, what, when, where), procedural (how), causal (why), conditional (what if), comparative (how does X compare to Y), and evaluative (to what extent). Develop specialized templates for each question word that align with appropriate content types (e.g., "who" for people, "where" for locations, "how" for processes). Track the distribution of question words across your generated dataset using simple frequency analysis with `collections.Counter`. Implement balancing algorithms that adjust generation priorities to maintain diversity, targeting specific distributions (e.g., ensuring "why" and "how" questions constitute at least 30% of the set). Use dependency parsing with `spaCy` to analyze sentence structures suitable for different question transformations. Create rules that match content types to appropriate question words (using NER tags to identify entities that match with specific question words). Implement validation checks that ensure question words appropriately match the content of the answer (e.g., "when" questions should have temporal answers). Consider semantic appropriateness when selecting question words, not just syntactic validity.

- **Vary sentence structures and complexity**: Create algorithms that generate syntactically diverse questions by implementing template variation systems. Develop a bank of syntactic patterns for each question type using different structures (simple, compound, complex sentences). Use controlled syntactic transformation with libraries like `nltk` to generate alternative phrasings of the same question content. Implement sentence complexity measures using features like tree depth from dependency parsing, clause count, or readability metrics with the `textstat` library. Create variation through strategic use of modifiers, prepositional phrases, and subordinate clauses. Implement linguistic register variation to generate both formal academic-style questions and more conversational forms. Use techniques like syntactic tree manipulation to systematically create alternative question structures. Track syntactic diversity using metrics like unique dependency structures or tree edit distance between generated questions. Implement controlled difficulty progression by gradually increasing syntactic complexity for related questions. Build validation mechanisms that ensure syntactic variations preserve the original question intent and semantic meaning while providing linguistic diversity.

- **Include both direct and indirect questions**: Develop a comprehensive question generation system that includes both straightforward interrogatives and embedded or indirect question forms. Create templates for direct questions with standard interrogative structures and question marks. Implement transformation rules that convert these into indirect forms (e.g., "Explain why..." instead of "Why...?", "Describe how..." rather than "How...?"). Use modal verbs and reporting structures to create indirect questions (e.g., "Can you describe...", "Discuss whether...", "Consider how..."). Implement phrase structure transformation using syntactic parsing to systematically convert between direct and indirect forms. Create topic-specific stems that frame questions appropriately for the domain (e.g., scientific inquiries versus historical analysis). Track the distribution between question types to maintain a balance (typically 70% direct, 30% indirect). Implement context-aware selection that chooses direct questions for factual content and indirect forms for more complex analytical topics. Create validation mechanisms that ensure indirect questions clearly communicate what information is being requested. Consider the instructional context when selecting question forms, as indirect questions often work well for essay-type responses while direct questions suit factual testing.

- **Implement multiple generation strategies to ensure stylistic variety**: Develop a diverse technical approach to question generation by implementing and orchestrating multiple complementary methods. Create a rule-based system using syntactic transformations with `spaCy` for high-precision factual questions. Implement template-based generation with hundreds of domain-specific templates using slot-filling approaches. Build neural generation capabilities using sequence-to-sequence models like `t5-base` or `bart-large` fine-tuned on question generation datasets (e.g., SQuAD, natural questions). Implement back-translation as a technique to create paraphrased variations of questions. Create hybrid approaches that combine the precision of rule-based methods with the creativity of neural approaches. Implement a question categorization system that tracks which generation method produced each question. Set target distributions to ensure variety (e.g., 30% rule-based, 30% template-based, 40% neural generation). Create ensemble techniques that generate questions using multiple methods and select the best versions based on quality metrics. Implement controlled random variation within templates by having multiple phrasings for each question type. Track stylistic diversity using embedding-based clustering to ensure questions cover different regions of the linguistic style space. Build model committee approaches that use disagreement between different generation methods to identify areas needing more variety.

### 4. Avoid problematic questions

- **Eliminate leading or biased questions that telegraph the answer**: Implement systematic detection and filtering of questions that hint at their answers or contain bias. Create an analysis pipeline using `nltk` or `spaCy` to identify lexical cues in questions that suggest a particular answer (e.g., "Isn't it true that..." or words that only appear in the context of specific answers). Implement neural classifiers trained on examples of leading questions to automatically flag problematic phrasings. Use sentiment analysis tools like `vaderSentiment` or `textblob` to detect loaded language in questions that reveals bias. Create heuristics to identify questions containing unnecessary adjectives that reveal the expected answer (e.g., "What devastating effects did X cause?" presupposes negativity). Implement statistical validation by comparing word distributions in questions with their answers to detect significant overlap that might telegraph the answer. Develop pattern matching for common leading question structures (e.g., "Don't you agree that..."). Use external bias detection tools like Google's Perspective API to identify potentially problematic phrasing. Create human review cycles focusing specifically on leading question detection. Implement automatic transformation rules that can neutralize biased questions by removing loaded language while preserving the core information request.

- **Filter out trivial generations (e.g., "What is [Subject]?")**: Develop comprehensive filtering mechanisms to eliminate overly simplistic questions that add little value to your dataset. Implement pattern matching with regular expressions to identify common trivial question forms like "What is X?" or "Who was Y?" when used without qualifiers or specificity. Create complexity scoring algorithms that evaluate questions based on linguistic features (sentence length, syntactic structure, vocabulary rarity) and information density using `textstat` and custom metrics. Implement neural classification using BERT-based models trained to distinguish between trivial and substantive questions. Create heuristics that flag questions where the answer contains substantially more information than the question itself. Implement semantic similarity comparison between questions and section headings to identify questions that merely ask for the topic of a section. Develop techniques to detect questions answerable with single-word responses or extremely short phrases. Create diversity-aware filtering that considers a question's uniqueness compared to others in the dataset. Implement automatic enhancement for trivial questions, adding specificity and focus (e.g., transforming "What is photosynthesis?" into "What are the primary chemical reactions involved in photosynthesis?"). Track the information gain of each question relative to others to eliminate those with minimal contribution.

- **Remove questions where the answer is the entire context**: Implement detection mechanisms to identify and filter questions that are too broad or general for the given context. Create algorithms that compare answer length to context length, flagging cases where the ratio exceeds a threshold (typically >70% overlap suggests an overly general question). Use semantic similarity measures with `sentence-transformers` to calculate overlap between potential answers and the full context. Implement extractiveness analysis to identify questions that would require repeating the entire passage rather than extracting or synthesizing specific information. Create heuristics based on question types that are typically too broad (e.g., "Summarize this passage" or "What does this text discuss?"). Implement neural classification using models trained to identify appropriate specificity levels for questions given a context. Create scope analysis using topic modeling to identify questions that encompass all topics in a passage rather than focusing on specific aspects. Develop transformation rules that can convert overly broad questions into more specific ones by adding constraints, focusing on subtopics, or specifying aspects of interest. Implement validation procedures that verify each question targets a specific information need addressable by a portion of the context. Track question specificity metrics across your dataset to ensure appropriate granularity.

## Answer Generation Best Practices

### 1. Ensure factual accuracy

- **Answers must be verifiable from the source text**: Implement rigorous verification systems to ensure all generated answers are firmly grounded in the source material. Develop extractive answer generation as a baseline approach, using span selection algorithms similar to those in reading comprehension models to identify text segments that directly answer questions. For more complex questions, implement evidence retrieval that identifies all relevant sentences or passages from the source text that contain supporting information. Create fact-checking algorithms that compare generated answers against source text using entailment models like `roberta-large-mnli` to verify that the answer is entailed by the source. Implement key fact extraction to identify critical assertions in both the source and generated answers, comparing them for consistency. For abstractive answers, use attribution tracking to link each major claim back to specific source locations. Develop confidence scoring mechanisms that rate answer reliability based on source evidence strength. Create warning flags for answers containing information not clearly supported by the text. Implement specialized verification for numerical facts, dates, and named entities using exact matching and normalization techniques. Consider implementing source citation generation that automatically includes references to specific sections or page numbers that support each answer.

- **Implement faithfulness checks using n-gram overlap or semantic similarity**: Develop multi-layered verification systems to ensure generated answers remain faithful to source content. Implement basic n-gram overlap checks using `nltk` or `sklearn` to measure BLEU, ROUGE, or METEOR scores between source passages and generated answers, setting minimum thresholds for acceptability. Create more sophisticated semantic similarity analysis using sentence embeddings from models like `sentence-transformers/all-mpnet-base-v2` to compare vector representations of answers and source passages, flagging answers below similarity thresholds (typically 0.7+). Implement entailment verification using natural language inference models like `roberta-large-mnli` to check if each sentence in the answer is entailed by the source text. Develop fact extraction and verification pipelines that identify key claims in answers and match them to supporting evidence in the source. Use named entity recognition to ensure all entities mentioned in answers appear in appropriate contexts in the source. Implement hallucination detection by identifying statements without source support. Create confidence scoring mechanisms that provide continuous measures of faithfulness rather than binary judgments. Implement specialized checking for numerical accuracy using digit recognition and normalization. Consider building ensemble verification that combines multiple techniques for higher reliability. Track faithfulness metrics across your dataset and implement threshold-based filtering for low-scoring answers.

### 2. Maintain appropriate length

- **Neither too brief nor unnecessarily verbose**: Implement intelligent length management systems that produce appropriately detailed answers. Create content-aware length guidance that adjusts expected answer length based on question complexity, topic importance, and available information using regression models trained on high-quality examples. Implement truncation and expansion algorithms that can adjust answer length while preserving core information. Develop information density metrics that identify answers with unnecessarily verbose language or repetitive content using features like type-token ratio, unique information units per sentence, and redundancy detection. Create length calibration by analyzing question complexity (e.g., factual questions typically need shorter answers than explanatory ones) and question word type (e.g., "why" questions generally require longer answers than "who" questions). Implement domain-specific length guidelines that account for field conventions (e.g., technical definitions vs. historical explanations). Use semantic compression techniques to condense verbose answers while preserving key information. Develop completeness checking to ensure brief answers include all necessary components to fully address the question. Implement statistical analysis of your dataset to establish appropriate length distributions by question and answer type, typically aiming for 2-4 sentences for simple factual questions and 4-8 sentences for complex explanatory ones.

- **Apply configurable minimum/maximum length filters**: Implement technical solutions for enforcing appropriate answer length constraints. Develop a configurable filtering system using `pandas` and basic text statistics to set minimum and maximum word or character counts for different question types. Create question-type recognition to apply different length constraints to different types (e.g., stricter limits for factual questions, broader ranges for explanatory ones). Implement adaptive thresholding that adjusts length requirements based on the complexity and information density of the source material. Develop domain-specific length configurations that account for terminology complexity and explanation requirements. Create length normalization procedures that can expand terse answers with additional context or compress verbose ones while preserving key information. Implement statistical analysis of ideal length distributions from high-quality examples, using standard deviations to set reasonable ranges. Develop progressive filtering that applies increasingly strict length constraints as dataset size grows. Create visualization tools using `matplotlib` or `seaborn` to monitor length distributions across question types and topics. Consider implementing length-aware sampling during dataset creation to maintain desired distributions.

Create context expansion algorithms that can retrieve additional relevant information when initial answers seem incomplete. Implement citation mechanisms that link to supporting evidence for key claims. Develop density-aware generation that balances information completeness with conciseness. Use answer templates for different question types that ensure all expected components are included (e.g., definition templates that include formal definition, examples, and limitations). Implement expert review criteria specifically for detecting information gaps. Consider using extractive summaries of relevant passages as input to abstractive generation models to ensure comprehensive coverage.

- **Ensure answers stand alone when reasonable**: Implement techniques to create self-contained answers that don't require referring back to the question or other content. Develop reference resolution that explicitly replaces pronouns and vague references with their antecedents using coreference resolution tools like `neuralcoref`. Create question incorporation techniques that elegantly restate key elements from the question in the answer without awkward repetition. Implement completeness checking that verifies all entities and concepts necessary for understanding are properly introduced in the answer. Develop context-aware generation that includes brief background or definitions for key terms when they're likely unfamiliar to the target audience. Create self-sufficiency scoring using readability and coherence metrics to identify answers that may be confusing in isolation. Implement domain knowledge modeling to determine when specialized terms need explanation versus when they can be assumed as known. Develop templates for different question types that incorporate appropriate context (e.g., comparison templates that restate both elements being compared). Build validation procedures that verify answers can be understood without seeing the question. Consider implementing a "cold reading" test where validators assess answer clarity without seeing the original question. Track self-sufficiency metrics across your dataset to ensure consistency.

### 4. Avoid ambiguity

- **Answers should be clear, specific, and directly responsive**: Implement precision-focused generation techniques to avoid vague or ambiguous answers.

Create clarity checking tools that detect vague language, hedging expressions, and imprecise references using libraries like `nltk` and custom lexicons of ambiguous terms. Implement directness verification that confirms answers address the specific question asked rather than discussing tangentially related topics. Develop answer type matching to ensure responses align with question types (e.g., "when" questions receive temporal answers, "how" questions receive process descriptions). Create automated checks for common ambiguity issues like unclear pronoun references, undefined abbreviations, or missing units for measurements. Implement contradictions detection using natural language inference models to identify inconsistent statements within answers. Develop domain-specific precision guidelines that enforce appropriate technical specificity. Use answer templates with clear structures for different question types to ensure all relevant aspects are addressed. Consider implementing peer-review simulation where one model generates answers and another identifies potential ambiguities.

- **Check that answers address the question's primary intent**: Implement intent-focused answer validation to ensure responses target what questions actually seek.

Develop neural relevance scoring using models fine-tuned on question-answer relevance tasks. Build conformity checking for domain-specific question conventions (e.g., how legal or medical questions should be answered). Consider implementing a two-stage generation process where the first stage identifies the question's primary intent and the second generates an appropriately structured response. Track intent satisfaction metrics across your dataset to identify patterns of misalignment.

### 5. Structure for different answer types
